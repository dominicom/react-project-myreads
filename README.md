## Project Overview

This is #7 student project made for Udacity classroom on Front-End Web Developer track.

#### Starter Project
> link https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter

#### Specification

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this template is to save time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. Student can choose to start with this template, His job is to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.

#### Backend Server

To simplify development process, there is provided a backend server for students to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/utils/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods that will be needed to perform necessary operations on the backend like:
* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

#### Important
The **backend API** uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

#### Main React Components Structure
```
<App />
  <Header />
